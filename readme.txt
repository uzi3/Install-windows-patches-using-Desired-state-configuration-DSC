Use this script to install patches on windows server using DSC feature. This script is specific to 2016 Domain Controllers. You can use this to deploy patches on any windows operating system by customizing the script provided the system should support DSC. You need to create a shared folder repository where all the patches will be kept. You need to create a folder named share which will contain subfolders in the format "2019-05" where 2019 is the year and 05 is the month. Under the month folder you need to create specific OS related folder like 2016 or 2012 R2 which will contain the patches. This folder will also contain a text file named "patchlist" which contains list of patches that needs to be installed. You just need to add the KB number like "123456" one below the other in this text file. The last line can be used to query configuration status of the server.
